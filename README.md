## Notes

While creating STEM Gap, there were a few issues. The most difficult issue was making sure that codes were placed in the correct place within that specific view controller swift file. Understanding directories and where to input those specific directories was a challenge. Another issue was receiving an error message stating “Use of unresolved identifier” and trying to understand how to fix the problem.
